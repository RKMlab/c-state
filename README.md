# C-State
## About
C-State (**'C'** the **C**hromatin **State**) is a webapp written using Vue and d3.js for epigenetic data visualization by biologists. It runs on all web browsers out of the box, and needs minimal user intervention. With C-State you can:

+ Automatically retrieve and display data relevant to your interest from whole-genome datasets
+ Simultaneously visualize multiple genes/genomic loci across chromosomes
+ Identify and filter genes based on user-defined search parameters
+ Compare epigenetic profile of gene subsets across multiple cell types and/or experimental conditions
+ Generate high quality gene-centric images documenting chromatin State

## Download
